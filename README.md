# Energy-Efficient-Multi-Path-Routing-Algorithm
This project implements an Energy Efficient Multi-Path Routing Algorithm, identifying energy-efficient paths in a network graph based on source, destination, node battery capacity, node viability threshold, and maximum paths to return. The output includes a list of paths that avoid low-battery nodes.
